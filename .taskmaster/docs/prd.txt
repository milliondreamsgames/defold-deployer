Claude Code Automated Log Monitoring for Defold Deployer

OVERVIEW
Implement a comprehensive Claude Code automated log monitoring system that transforms the Defold deployer from reactive debugging to proactive intelligence. The system monitors build and deployment processes in real-time, provides intelligent error analysis, automated troubleshooting suggestions, and team integration.

OBJECTIVES
1. Real-time monitoring of build and deployment processes
2. Intelligent error detection and classification
3. Automated troubleshooting suggestions and recovery mechanisms  
4. Team integration with webhook notifications
5. Knowledge sharing and pattern learning across builds
6. Minimal disruption to existing workflow

CORE COMPONENTS

Session Management System
- claude-log-monitor.sh script with session lifecycle management
- JSON metadata for session tracking and recovery
- Context checkpointing every 5 minutes
- Named pipe communication between processes
- Resource cleanup and error handling

Deployer Integration
- Environment variable controls for enabling monitoring
- Build phase hooks without disrupting existing workflow
- Log streaming to Claude with structured output
- Platform detection and context awareness
- Backward compatibility maintenance

Enhanced Progress System
- Error pattern recognition during builds
- Real-time visual feedback for detected issues
- Performance monitoring with threshold alerts
- Structured JSON logging for Claude consumption
- Color-coded indicators for different issue types

Team Integration
- Webhook notifications for Slack/Discord
- Smart alerting for critical issues only
- Rich notification format with analysis and suggestions
- Rate limiting to prevent notification spam
- Shared knowledge base for resolved issues
